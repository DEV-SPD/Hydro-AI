# DESCRIPTION
Our project aims to harness the power of artificial intelligence to monitor and maintain the quality of water sources. We have developed an integrated system that utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to continuously analyze and assess various water quality parameters, including pH levels, contaminants, and temperature. The real-time monitoring system is equipped with sensors placed in strategic locations to provide accurate data. When deviations from acceptable water quality standards are detected, the system triggers alerts and notifications for prompt response and corrective action. By implementing this technology, we contribute to the preservation of our environment and the sustainable management of vital water resources.

# TECHSTACK
  1. Python & its libraries
  2. Streamlit

# FEATURES
  1. Realtime Monitoring
  2. Alerts and Notifications
  3. Remote Access
  4. Accurate Forecasting

# Info
Output is safe:
1. Water Quality Assurance: Our system provides real-time monitoring, and when the result indicates "safe," it means the water quality is within predefined standards, ensuring it's suitable for its intended use.

2. No Immediate Action Required: A "safe" result signifies that there's no need for immediate intervention or corrective action, offering peace of mind to users.

3. Continuous Monitoring: Even when water quality is "safe," our system continues to monitor, allowing timely detection of deviations and proactive response if needed.

4. Customizable Thresholds: We understand that "safe" can vary, so our system allows users to customize thresholds to align with local regulations or specific requirements.

5. Long-Term Sustainability: Consistently achieving "safe" results contributes to the sustainable management of water resources and supports environmental conservation 
   efforts.
